This is the first course project in the Reproducible Research Coursera Course and is an attempt to answer several questions about data obtained from activity data.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
url<-"http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(url, "activity.zip")
unzip("activity.zip", exdir = getwd())
data<-read.csv("activity.csv")
by.date<-aggregate(steps~date, data=data, sum)
mean.total <- mean(by.date$steps)
median.total <- median(by.date$steps)
```

As can be seen from the histogram below, the vast majority of the days total steps are between 10,000 and 15,000.  In fact, the mean is `r mean.total` and the median is `r median.total`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(by.date$steps, main="Steps Taken by Day", xlab="Total Steps",
     col="blue")
```
